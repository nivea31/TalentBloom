# Overview

We are developing a AI-Driven Resume and Job Matching System name as TalentBloom for the Job-Seekers. The AI-Driven Resume and Job Matching System revolutionizes talent acquisition by intelligently aligning candidates with the most suitable job opportunities. Leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms and natural language processing (NLP), the system analyzes job descriptions and candidate profiles to ensure precise matching. Through data-driven insights and predictive analytics, it enhances recruitment efficiency, reduces hiring complexities, and fosters meaningful employer-employee connections. This intelligent platform streamlines the hiring process, minimizes bias, and optimizes workforce alignment, resulting in improved talent retention and organizational success.

# Key features include

- Intelligent parsing and skill extraction from candidate profiles
- Role matching based on skill alignment, proficiency, and domain relevance
- Data-driven optimization for faster and more efficient hiring
- Scalable design for integration into enterprise recruitment platforms
